# Sensor Name
# Symbol name.  Symbol name as to match a symbol in lcd_custom_chars. Alternatively, enter only one character to use directly if no symbol exists.  This symbol is used on the LCD.
# Pin mode. PULLUP, PULLDOWN, or FLOATING
# Polling period in millisecond.  The value of the sensor has to be the same 2 readings in a row to be accepted (for debouncing purposes.)
# normally_closed or normally_opened
# Sensor type. type_intrusion or type_fire
# List of states in which the sensor is armed. ANY if the sensor is always armed.
# disarming grace when armed. (0: disable the grace period, 1: default ("disarming grace delay"), or delay in seconds).
